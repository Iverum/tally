# Tally

> An desktop application for tagging and searching media built with Electron & React.

Tally is my attempt to satisfy my categorical desires without having to rely on third-party solutions that either store data in the cloud or utilize awkward tagging constructions that modify files.

### Getting started
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Iverum/tally.git
cd tally
npm i
npm start
```
